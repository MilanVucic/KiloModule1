    // 1. Write a program to test if an array contains a specific value.
    // 2. Write a program to find greatest common divisor (GCD) of given two numbers.
    // Ex: num1 = 50, num2 = 20, output=10; 17 and 9 -> 1; 100 and 10 -> 10
    // 3. Write a program to check whether a number is perfect or not. Perfect = equal to the sum of all of its dividers.
    // 6 is perfect, dividers = 1,2,3 -> 1+2+3 = 6
    // 28 -> 1 2 4 7 14

    // 4. Write a program to find the index of an array element. (-1 if not found)
    // arr - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], num = 4, output -> 3, num = 9, output -> -1
    // you can also implement LAST index of
    // arr [1,2,3,2,3], num=3, output = 4

    // 5. Write a program to find the number of even and odd integers in a given array of integers.
